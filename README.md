## Primarily, An unsupervised learning model using Twitter API and Tweepy that lets you analyse and determine polarity of views of users on a trending topic through keyword analysis of tweets. On a broader scope, this might help companies engaging with their customers on a better note.
Project made by Rohan Fouzdar and Shambhavi Priya
So, When the model is actually performed against an example, say: "Dhoni"

We get:

Positive tweet% about "Dhoni" among the present tweet samples.

Negative tweet% about "Dhoni" among the present tweet samples.

Tweet% that didn't have words sentimentally strong enough to be classified under any of the positive/negative tweet category.

 Prerequisites: Knowledge of Regex,Tweepy,Sentiment Polarity Analysis and Textblob
 
 Scope of improvement: Facing strong interface issues; only the model is in a developed stage.
